Customer understands that, if the system installed is monitored, due to the nature of the method used for communicating alarm signals to SCSSâ€™s monitoring center, there may be timeswhen that communication method is not able to transmit signals and SCSS will not receive alarm signals. Digital communicators use standard telephone lines and SCSS does notreceive signals when the telephone system becomes non-operational or the telephone line is placed on vacation status, cut, interfered with or otherwise damaged. There will betimes when any radio frequency method, such as cellular, public or private radio systems or Internet based service, cannot transmit an alarm signal due to lack of signal strength,network congestion, or availability of a communications channel. Similarly, any other type of communication method installed under this Agreement also can experience an inabilityto communicate alarm signals. Customer understands that SCSS offers several levels of communication methods of alarm signals to the monitoring center and that the Servicesdescribed  on  the  Schedule  have  been  chosen  by  Customer  after  considering  and  balancing  the  levels  of  protection  afforded  by  various  communication  methods  and  the  relatedcosts. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for the selection of the type of communication method and whether the utilization of more than onecommunication method is required. Communications networks provided by independent carriers or providers are wholly beyond SCSSâ€™s control and are maintained and serviced,solely  by  the  applicable  carrier  or  provider.  Customer  agrees  to  reimburse  SCSS  for  any  costs  incurred  to  reprogram  the  communicator  because  of  area  code  changes  or  otherdialing pattern changes. If telephone service is used, the use of DSL or other broadband telephone service may prevent the system from transmitting alarm signals to the monitoringcenter and/or interfere with the telephone line-seizure feature of the system. Such services should be installed on a telephone number that is not used for alarm signal transmission.Customer agrees to notify SCSS if Customer has installed or intends to install DSL or other broadband service.
